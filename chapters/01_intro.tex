\gls{hri} explores the challenges of developing robots to interact in human environments and studies how human beings react to such robots. While not being present in every home yet, robots are quickly propagating through society and entering people's life. %~\citep{friedman2003hardware,forlizzi2006service}.
%for instance as vacuum cleaners, pets, assistants or even friends~\citep{belpaeme2012multimodal}. 
To interact in human environments and fill their role for society, robots require a way to interpret their sensory inputs and act on the social world; in other words, they need to be sociable~\citep{breazeal2004designing}. However, interacting socially with humans is a complex task: the social interaction happens on multiple levels and combines elements from various fields~\citep{fong2003survey}. Furthermore, by interacting with humans, robots are subjects to social norms and have to take them into account when behaving around people~\citep{bartneck2004design}. Providing robots with such a complex action policy is a challenge, and no static controller programmed manually would cover all the possible situations they could face. To interact meaningfully with humans, robots need to learn, constantly expanding and refining their action policy. As such, it stands to reason to use the experts in humans interactions, the humans themselves to teach robots to interact socially. By providing control over the robot's actions to a human teacher, a robot could learn efficient policies for social interactions from in-situ human supervision. Interactively learning from humans presents a change of paradigm compared to traditional machine learning, as the human possesses knowledge they can transfer to the robot, improving the learning process~\citep{fails2003interactive,amershi2014power}. Finally, by initially framing this work in the context of \gls{hri} we added to the interaction a large set of constraints (high-stakes environment, complexity of state, low number of datapoint and real time interaction). Consequently, by exploring how to learn in such a complex environment this research work would have applications beyond \gls{hri}, e.g. to general robotic, \gls{ml} and \gls{ai}.

\section{Scope}\label{sec:intro_scope}

As shown in \cite{goodrich2007human} only a subset of \gls{hri} is designed to be inherently social. Using Goodrich and Schultz's definition of \gls{hri}, as the study of robots for use by or with humans, an important part of the field does not consider the social side of the interaction. Robots are often considered as asocial entities having a task to complete or simply tools to be used by humans. However, as demonstrated by \cite{fincannon2004evidence}, even when used as teleoperated machines, robots still provoke social reactions and expectations from humans. \cite{fong2003survey} make, among others, the distinction between ``evocative robots'' and ``socially interactive robots''. Evocative robots rely on human tendency to anthropomorphise to succeed in their task, while for ``socially interactive robots'' the social side of the interaction is key. However in \gls{hri}, the sociality of the interaction might not be intended or even desired but may simply emerge as a by-product of the interaction. As a consequence, in this work we will refer to `social robots' as robots interacting in humans environments and considered as social agents by the humans interacting with them. The intentions of the robot designer or the actual robot's sociality are of minor importance if the humans interacting with the robot project social competencies or expectations on the robot. Regardless on the initial intentions, a robot interacting with humans needs to manage these expectations to ensure the safety and comfort of its human partners. In summary, as soon as a robot interacts with humans, the social side of the interaction needs to be taken into account, the robot needs a social policy. 

%As described by \cite{goodrich2007human}, \gls{hri} studies ``robotic system for use by or with humans'', consequently, it covers the full spectrum of interactions between humans and robots ranging from physical assistance and teleoperation to social companions. In \cite{fong2003survey}, authors refer to ``socially interactive robots'', as ``robot for which social interaction plays a key role''. As such, these socially interactive robots exclude robot interacting purely physically with humans, such as exoskeleton, physical rehabilitation or pure teleoperation as in robotic assisted surgery. However, even with robots not intended to behave socially, humans might create bonds and relationships \cite{fincannon2004evidence}. As such, this review extends the concept of ``socially interactive robots'' not only to robots designed to interact socially, but to robots eliciting social response from the hu

%if a robot is consider as a social agent, it needs to be able to interact socially

%social robots = robots perceived as social agents in human environments.

However, enabling a robot to interact socially with humans is a complex task. The robot needs to make sense of a large input space, from low level sensory feedback (e.g. joint angles or camera pixels) to high level concepts (e.g. hand-coded events or learned features). And based on the interpretation of these inputs and rules defining a behaviour, the robot needs to select an action or a plan to achieve an assigned goal. As this task covers most of the areas of robotics~\citep{fong2003survey}, this section will precise the scope of the research conducted in this thesis.

\subsection{Frame}

The context of the research conducted here is finding a way for robots to interact efficiently with humans. It has been argued by many researchers ~\citep{dautenhahn2004robots,billard2008robot} that robots need to adapt to their users and be able to learn from them. Social robots cannot simply apply a one-size-fits-all policy programmed in advance by engineers and suited to every possible interaction partners. Robots need the capability to learn an interactive behaviour, improving their skills as they inhabit the world and personalising their policy to their users. This thesis aims to tackle this challenge and enable robots to learn to interact with humans.

Throughout this thesis we make the assumption that a human knows how the robot should interact. A person, generally not the engineers initially developing the robot, possesses some expertise which should be transferred to a robot. This expertise is not related to theoretical knowledge in \gls{ml}, robotics or other scientific fields but defines how the robot should behave. For instance,  it could take the form of the steps of a therapy a robot should deliver to the child (known by a therapist) or more simply a senior's preferences and desires concerning a robot companion's behaviour. As a consequence, robot users should be able to teach their robot %, to transfer their knowledge to their robot
 without requiring technical expertise.

Although the ultimate goal of this research is to explore how robots could learn to interact socially and efficiently with humans; by making the assumption that the interaction knowledge should be provided by a human, the resulting question of this thesis is: \emph{`How humans could teach robots to interact?'}. As such, this research work aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for domain experts to inculcate robots with their interaction knowledge. To do so, this research explores the requirements on an interaction framework allowing humans to teach robots to interact socially in human environments and studies the impacts such a framework would have on the interaction.

%\subsection{Environment} 
\subsection{Type of Interaction}
In \gls{hri} a robot has to solve a task with or for a human, we coin this interaction the \emph{application interaction}. However, by focusing the research on using humans to teach robots, we add a second human-robot interaction to this application interaction: the \emph{teaching interaction} between the robot and the teacher. The end goal of this new teaching interaction is to achieve high standards in the application interaction. This results in two intertwined human-robot interactions: the application interaction, between the application target and the robot and the teaching interaction, between the teacher and the robot (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}), which is equivalent to a general triadic interaction between the human target, the robot and the human teacher.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{setup.pdf}
	\centering
	\caption{The typical interaction used in this research: a robot interacts with a target in an application interaction and learns from a domain expert through a teaching interaction.}
	\label{fig:intro_setup}
\end{figure}

While having been pursued by considering mostly \gls{hri} as the application interaction, the work presented in this thesis is applicable to teaching a robot, or more generally an agent, a behaviour not limited to human robot interaction. Indeed, interacting with a human is a high stake scenario, where misbehaving can be costly, where datapoints for learning can be tedious to acquire and with a high diversity between different partners. Other types of interaction could be less constrained, complex or with lower stakes. Consequently, by addressing a challenging task (teaching a robot to interact socially with humans), this approach would also suited to a wide range of other tasks (such as manipulation, classification or navigation). In the more general case, we consider scenarios where a user has a task they would like an artificial agent to complete and they have useful knowledge they want to transfer to this agent. Through the teaching interaction, the human can supervise the agent, demonstrating what it should do and teaching it an efficient action policy in the application interaction with the target. 

%The application target could be another human (such as a child receiving teaching support from the robot) or just parts of the environment if the robot has to complete a manipulation of navigation task (such as picking up a book in the library).

%Mention more the social side of the interaction??

%Robots considered in this thesis evolve in human-centred environments and are expected to provide some support to the surrounding humans and achieve a specific goal assigned to them. Human interactions and by extend human environments are in essence social, they are governed by social norms, and on the adhesion to these norms depends the success of the interaction.

\section{The Thesis}\label{sec:intro_thesis}
The main thesis this document proposes is the following:
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{A robot can learn to interact meaningfully with humans in an efficient and safe way by receiving supervision from a human teacher in control of the robot's behaviour.}
	%This supervision will lead to an efficient, safe and low human-workload teaching and autonomous behaviour.	
\end{quote}

This thesis raises a series of additional research questions; and, in the pursuit of supporting the main thesis, this research work addressed the six research questions presented below.

The first two questions correspond to a theoretical analysis of the field of social \gls{hri} and a proposition of an interaction framework allowing humans to teach robots in high stakes environments such as \gls{hri}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [RQ1] \emph{What are the requirements of a robot controller to ensure a behaviour suited to \gls{hri}?} 
	
		By interacting with humans, robots enter the social world and have to conform to human expectations while ensuring they can reach their goal. This research question studies the constraints put on the robot's controller by interacting in the human world. 
		
    \item [RQ2] \emph{What interaction framework would allow a human to teach a robot while validating the requirements from RQ1?}
    
    	%While RQ1 provides requirements for a robot controller, the task of designing a interaction framework allowing a human to teach remains. 
    	This research question address what principles could lead to an efficient teaching interaction between a robot and a human whilst validating the requirements from RQ1 for the interaction between the robot and the target. 
\end{itemize}    	

Then, questions 3 and 4 are focused on the teaching interaction and evaluate the specific relation between the teacher and the robot. As such these questions correspond to situations where the application interaction is fixed and repeatable. These controlled application interactions help us to characterise the teaching interaction, and analyse if it would be suited to teach a robot to interact with humans.
\begin{itemize}
    \item [RQ3] \emph{Could a robot decrease its supervisor's workload by learning from their supervision?}
    
        Controlling a robot is a significant workload for the human supervisor. This question explores if including a learning component in the robot behaviour could alleviate the human workload by taking over some of the mental and physical requirements of the robot control. Additionally, this question explores if this learning impacts the performance in the task.
%        \gls{woz} is an approach widely used in \gls{hri}~\citep{riek2012wizard}, whereby a human teleoperates a robot to have it interact with other humans. However, this method applies a high workload on the operator and is not scalable. Using \gls{ml} to learn from this operator online might decrease the operator's workload without decreasing the quality of the robot behaviour.
    
    \item [RQ4] \emph{How does providing the teacher with control over the learner's actions impact the teaching process?} 
    
    	Teaching robots has a unique property compared to teaching humans in the fact that the teacher can have total control over the learner's actions. This question explores if this control could lead to a faster and more efficient learning while lightening the process for the teacher.
	%    In the context of \gls{iml}, a human can provide inputs to an agent to speed up the learning. Other \gls{iml}~\citep{thomaz2008teachable,knox2009interactively} focus on feedback from the human with limited or no control over the agent's actions. However, increasing the control should speed up the learning and reduce the number of errors made by the robot.
\end{itemize}    	

Finally, questions 5 and 6 evaluate the implications of having a human directly teaching a robot to interact with another human in a real situation, more precisely in the context of child tutoring.
\begin{itemize}
	\item [RQ5] \emph{How does teaching a robot to interact socially impact the two humans involved in the overall triadic interaction?}
%		How an interaction framework validating the requirements from RQ1 impact humans interacting with a robot when it is learning?}

		%RQ2 explores how a teaching framework could in theory validate the requirements from RQ1. 
		Using humans to teach robots to interact with other humans results in two linked interactions. This questions studies the impact of the teaching process on these two interactions: are the requirements from RQ1 validated in the application interaction, and is the teaching interaction efficient and convenient for the teacher.
		%This research question evaluates if the framework proposed by exploring RQ2 would satisfy the requirements from RQ1 during the teaching process. 
		%Talk about impacts on both humans?
		
    \item [RQ6] \emph{After receiving supervision from a human, could a robot behave autonomously in a social context?}
%    \item [RQ5] \textbf{How can a human teach a robot to interact with other humans?} %???

	 	After having been taught, a robot could be deployed to interact autonomously in the real world. This questions analyses the robot's behaviour when interacting autonomously and explores the efficiency of a teaching in situ in providing the robot an autonomous behaviour validating principles from RQ1.
	 	%\gls{sparc} has been designed to allow non-experts in \gls{ml} to teach agents how to interact during the interaction. Human-robot interactions provide a perfect test for this approach: using a human to teach a robot how to behave in this complex and non-deterministic environment.
	 
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach and Experimentation}

\subsection{Review of the State of the Art in \gls{hri}}
%\ES{not great but a start}
The first step toward answering the RQ1 and identifying the requirements interacting with humans puts on robot was to review the different fields of application of social \gls{hri}. In each type of interaction, the robot will interact with people with different specificities and needs, and by analysing these fields, we can draw the requirements such interactions put on the robot's controller. For this survey, we limited the applications to cases where humans consider the robot as a social agent, as this is the main feature we use to define social \gls{hri}.

\subsection{New Teaching Framework}
%\ES{to improve}
To address the requirements on a robot controller emerging by addressing RQ1, we propose the \gls{sparc}, a novel teaching framework intended to provide a way for non-experts in robotics to safely teach a robot to interact with humans. \gls{sparc} is the cornerstone of this thesis and this research work describes and justifies this approach, and evaluates its impact though three studies of increasing complexity.

\subsection{Study Design} 

To address the main thesis of this work and RQ3 to RQ6, we designed and ran three studies, which are described in details in the Chapters~\ref{chap:woz} to~\ref{chap:tutoring}. These studies evaluated the impacts of \gls{sparc} on different parts of the teaching and application interactions. The first two studies focused on the teaching interaction, i.e. the impact of \gls{sparc} on the teachers and the relation between the teacher and the robot. As a consequence, they required repeatable environments to compare humans' efficiency and experiences when teaching a robot. The last study applied \gls{sparc} to a real \gls{hri} and was run in a school with a single human teaching a robot to interact with children over multiple sessions. Its main goal was to explore if \gls{sparc} can be used to teach a robot to interact with humans. All the studies used \gls{sparc} in the type of interaction presented in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}, i.e. a teacher wants a robot to complete a task (included but not limited to human interaction) and can control the robot's actions through an interface. As each study focused on different features of \gls{sparc}, bespoke interaction environments and test benches have been developed for each study.

The first study (Chapter~\ref{chap:woz}) explored if \gls{sparc} could be used to provide learning to a robot in a \gls{woz} interaction and if this learning would impact the workload and performance of the teacher in the task. We took inspiration from \gls{rat} and decided to replace the child interacting with the wizarded-robot by a second robot running a model of a child displaying typical features observed in children (such as non-deterministic behaviour, partial observability of state and absence of easily definable optimal action policy). This repeatable environment allowed us to evaluate in a controlled study the impact of \gls{sparc} on the teacher and compare \gls{sparc} to \gls{woz}.

The second study (Chapter~\ref{chap:control}) compared \gls{sparc} to another \gls{iml} method: \gls{irl} in a replication of the virtual environment initially used to test \gls{irl}. The main difference between the two methods resides in the quantity of control provided to the teacher; unlike \gls{irl}, \gls{sparc} provides teachers with full control over the robot's actions. In this study, participants controlled a virtual robot on a computer and had to teach it how to solve a task in a deterministic virtual environment.

Finally, the last study (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}) deployed \gls{sparc} in a real interaction with humans, to teach children about food chains. This study used the paradigm described in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}: a child is playing an educative game with a robot on a large touchscreen and the robot is remotely controlled and taught by an adult using a tablet. That way, using \gls{sparc}, the robot can learn to support the child in the educative activity and increase their engagement and performance in the task.

%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learning Algorithms}
To enable robots to learn from humans, they need to be equipped with \acrfull{ml}, i.e. an algorithm statistically learning a mapping between some inputs and outputs. Two main categories of \gls{ml} are relevant for this research: \gls{sl} and \gls{rl}.

\gls{sl} aims to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs to automatically reproduce a desired known behaviour. It uses a dataset of labelled example and optimises an algorithm to minimise the prediction error of labels~\citep{russell2016artificial}. Typical examples of \gls{sl} used in this study are \gls{ann} and nearest neighbours methods. \gls{ann} model loosely the way brains and neurons work by having a group of interconnected `neurons' influencing each other. By changing the connections between the neurons, the network learns to reproduce the desired values on the output nodes according to the inputs. On the other hand, nearest neighbours methods are instance based methods, they compare the distance in a feature space between a point to classify and the different instances stored in a dataset and select the value of a majority of nearest neighbours in that space. With its goal, reproducing a desired behaviour, \gls{sl} is especially connected with the work carried out in this research. By learning to reproduce the teacher's policy, the robot should reach an efficient behaviour in the target application.

Unlike \gls{sl} which reproduces a known behaviour, \gls{rl} aims at providing an agent with the capacity to discover and explore the world it inhabits and learn from this interaction with the world how to behave in this world~\citep{sutton1998reinforcement}. The agent has access to a description of the state and actions it can do, and depending of the action selected, the state will change and the agent will receive a reward. The goal of the agent is to find an optimal policy maximising a notion of cumulated reward. \gls{rl} is also linked to the work presented in this thesis: by allowing an agent (here a robot) to learn by interacting a world (here human environments), we would reach our goals of efficient human-robot interactions.

Due to the relevance of both fields to this research (enabling robots to learn to interact), algorithms from both categories have been used. The first study presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:woz} used a feed forward neural network learning to reproduce a teacher policy. The second study in Chapter~\ref{chap:control} used \gls{rl} to combine human guidance, and environmental and human rewards to learn an efficient action policy. The last study presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring} used an instance based algorithm adapted from Nearest Neighbours to enable online quick and efficient learning from human commands. More details about each algorithms and their related work can be found in the associated chapters.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Graphs presented throughout this thesis have been generated using the seaborn package for Python and matplotlib \citep{waskom2017seaborn}. Data have been usually represented using violin plots, a graphical representation featuring the probability density of the data. Statistical analysis in Chapters~\ref{chap:control} and~\ref{chap:tutoring} have been made using the Jasp software \citep{jasp2018}. Jasp offers a Bayesian counterpart to classic statistical test, making them more robust and allowing to observe the presence or absence of effect. As such, instead of a \emph{p-value}, the Bayes factor $B$ is reported and represents how much of the variance on the metric is explained by a parameter (if $B < 1/3$ there is no impact, if $B > 3$ the impact is strong, and if $1/3<B<3$ the results are inconclusive; \citealt{jeffreys1998theory,dienes2011bayesian}). 

\subsection{Terminology}

Throughout this thesis, the terms `wizard', `supervisor', `user', `expert' and `teacher' have been used interchangeably to represent the people in control of a robot's action and teaching that robot an action policy. Similarly, we refers to the robot as `robot', `agent' or `learner' depending of the situation.

\section{Contributions}\label{sec:intro_contr}

This research work contributed both scientifically (by creating and evaluating \gls{sparc}) and technically (by developing software for multiple projects) to the state of the art in \gls{hri} and especially in teaching robots to interact with humans. This section highlights the original contribution of this thesis and indicates the relevant chapters and published work.

\subsection{Scientific Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first contribution, and the cornerstone of this work is the \textbf{\acrfull{sparc}}, a new interaction framework to \textbf{teach robot to interact in complex and high stakes environments}, whereby a robot progressively gain autonomy while being supervised by a human. (Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc}; \citealt{senft2015human,senft2015sparc}).
	\item We then evaluate \gls{sparc} in \textbf{three studies} of increasing complexity and culminating to \textbf{teaching a robot to support child learning} in the wild. (Chapters~\ref{chap:woz},~\ref{chap:control} and~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2015sparc,senft2017supervised,senft2018robots}).
	\item We demonstrated the impact and importance of the \textbf{teacher's control over the robot's action} when teaching a robot: it makes the \textbf{teaching safer, faster, easier and more efficient} (Chapter~\ref{chap:control}; \citealt{senft2016sparc,senft2017supervised}).
	\item We designed a lightweight algorithm adapted from \textbf{nearest-neighbours}, but defined on a \textbf{sliced version of the state and using rewards} to quickly \textbf{learn from demonstrations in multidimensional environments} (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2017toward}).
	\item Application of \acrlong{iml} to \textbf{safely teach robots social autonomy} from in situ human supervision in a \textbf{real human-robot interaction} (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2018robots}). This is one of the \textbf{main contributions} one as allowing robot to learn to interact with human in situ presents many advantages compared to other types of learning but is seldom used in \gls{hri} due the challenges it presents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of three different studies to evaluate \gls{sparc} in three different applications, with dedicated interface for the teacher, and combing \gls{sparc} with a different algorithm each time.
	\item Partial development of a cognitive architecture and two tools for the \acrshort{dream} project (European FP7 project: 611391) (Appendix~\ref{app:dream}; \citealt{esteban2017build}).
	\item Development of an autonomous robot controller to support cardiac rehabilitation in the Human-Robot Interaction Strategies for Rehabilitation based on Socially Assistive Robotics project (Royal Academy of Engineering: IAPP\textbackslash1516\textbackslash137)~\citep{lara2017human,casas2018social}.
	\item Development of a wizard interface for the Freeplay-Sandbox\footnote{\url{https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox}}~\citep{lemaignan2017free}.

\section{Structure}\label{sec:intro_struct}
%From James, could probably be updated

The structure of this thesis is described below with an overview of the content for each chapter. Chapters~\ref{chap:sparc} to \ref{chap:tutoring} start with a summary of the key elements to clarify their contribution.

\begin{itemize}
	%From James, could probably be updated
	\item This chapter introduced to the general scope and context of this research (robots learning to interact with and from humans), presented the main thesis put forward by this work as well as the technical and scientific contributions and the additional research questions addressed throughout the thesis .

	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:background} provides a description of the different fields of social \gls{hri} and draws requirements for controllers of robots interacting with humans. In a second part, it analyses the current robot controllers used in \gls{hri} identifying that no current controller fits these requirements. Finally, it introduces \gls{iml} and proposes to apply it to \gls{hri} as a way to validate the previously defined requirements.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc} proposes a new interaction framework, \gls{sparc}, as a way to apply \gls{iml} to \gls{hri} while validating the three requirements proposed in Chapter~\ref{chap:background}. This chapter describes the principles behind \gls{sparc} and the expectations and limits this method could have.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:woz} presents a first study evaluating the impact of \gls{sparc} on the supervisor's workload and performance compared to \gls{woz}. Results showed that \gls{sparc} allowed teachers to achieve a good performance, while reducing their workload.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:control} presents a second study comparing \gls{sparc} to \gls{irl}, another interaction framework from \gls{iml}. The main difference between the two approaches lied in the amount of control the teacher has: with \gls{sparc}, the teacher can correct any action executed by the robot. Results from a 40 participants study supported that this control improves the efficiency of the learning (improving the performance, reducing the time and the number of inputs required to teach as well as decreasing the risks taken during the teaching phase and imposing a lower workload on the teacher).
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring} presents the first study where \gls{sparc} has been applied to a real world \gls{hri}, child tutoring, and to our knowledge one of the first time online learning has been used to teach robots to interact with humans. Results demonstrate that, while not impacting the learning gain of the session, a supervised robot elicited richer child behaviour compared to a passive robot. Furthermore, by learning using \gls{sparc}, an autonomous robot reached a policy similar to the teacher's one and achieved similar impacts on the children. These results support \gls{sparc} as a teaching method allowing to transfer in situ a social and technical action policy from a human to a robot in a safe way and leading to an efficient autonomous behaviour. The findings are key for this thesis as they demonstrate the applicability of \gls{sparc} to high-stakes, unpredictable, multidimensional, multimodal and complex environments.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} presents a discussion of the main findings from the previous chapters in relation to the research questions introduced in this chapter, discusses the limitations and future directions of research for \gls{sparc} as well as its potential impact on \gls{hri} and other fields.

	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes the thesis by presenting a summary and stating the main contributions.
