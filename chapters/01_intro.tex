\gls{hri} what it is and what it matters and why it is challenging

Robots will inhabit human spaces and need to interact with them in decent ways

\section{Scope}\label{sec:intro-scope}

\subsection{Frame}

\subsection{Environment} \label{sec:scope-social}
Robot interacting in an environment shared with humans / directly with humans
presence of a supervisor who can provide feedback/commands

\subsection{Type of interaction}

\subsection{Algorithms}

Three different algorithms have been used in the progress of this research. The first study presented in Chapter \ref{chap:woz} uses feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer. the second study in Chapter \ref{chap:control} used \acrlong{rl} combining human and environmental rewards into a single reward source for the algorithm. And the last study presented in Chapter \ref{chap:tutoring} uses instance based algorithm adapted from Nearest Neighbours to enable quick and efficient learning. More details about each algorithms and their related work can be found in the associated chapters.

\section{The Thesis}\label{sec:intro-thesis}
The main thesis that this document seeks to put forward is as below.

A robot can learn how to interact meaningfully with humans by receiving teaching
content from a human supervisor which leads to an efficient, safe and
low human-workload interaction policy.
%One sentence to describe the take home/conclusion

Additional research questions have been explored during the progress of this
work and are introduced here.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Does adding a learning component to a supervised robot can reduce the human-workload of the supervisor?}
    
        \gls{woz} is an approach widely used in \gls{hri} \citep{riek2012wizard}, whereby a human teleoperates a robot to have it interact with other humans. However, this method applies a high workload on the operator and is not scalable. Using \gls{ml} to learn from this operator online might decrease the operator's workload without decreasing the quality of the robot behaviour.
    
    \item \textbf{How control of a teacher over the robot's action impacts the robot's learning?} 
    
	    In the context of \gls{iml}, a human can provide inputs to an agent to speed up the learning. Other \gls{iml} \citep{thomaz2008teachable,knox2009interactively} focus on feedback from the human with limited or no control over the agent's actions. However increase the control should speed up the learning and reduce the number of errors made by the robot.

    \item \textbf{How could a human teach a robot how to interact with other humans?}

	 \gls{sparc} has been designed to allow non-experts in \gls{ml} to teach agents how to interact while interacting. Human-robot interactions provide a perfect test for this approach: using a human to teach a robot how to behave in this complex and non-deterministic environment.
