\gls{hri} explores the challenges of developing robots that interact in human environments, and studies how human beings react to such robots. While not being present in most homes yet, robots are quickly penetrating society and entering people's life. 
To interact in human environments and take up their role in society, social robots require a way to interpret their sensory inputs and act on the social world; in other words, they need to be sociable~\citep{breazeal2004designing}. However, interacting socially with humans is a complex task: the social interaction happens on multiple levels and combines elements from various fields~\citep{fong2003survey}. Furthermore, by interacting with humans, robots are subjects to social norms and have to take them into account when behaving around people~\citep{bartneck2004design}. 

Providing robots with such a complex policy is a challenge, and no static controller programmed manually would cover all the possible situations they could face. To interact meaningfully with humans, robots need to learn, constantly expanding and refining their policy. As such, it stands to reason to use the experts in humans interactions, which are the humans themselves, to teach robots to interact socially. 

By providing control over the robot's actions to a human teacher, a robot could learn efficient policies for social interactions from \textit{in situ} human tutelage and supervision. Interactively learning from humans presents a change of paradigm compared to traditional machine learning, as the human possesses knowledge they can interactively transfer to the robot, allowing for online and adaptive teaching and learning~\citep{fails2003interactive,amershi2014power}. Finally, by framing this work in the context of \gls{hri} we added to the interaction numerous challenges: high-stakes environment (an environment where incorrect actions can have serious consequences), large state and action spaces, relatively low number of datapoints, and real time interaction. Consequently, by exploring how to learn in such a complex environment this research work could have applications beyond \gls{hri}, e.g. in general robotics or \gls{ml}.

\section{Scope}\label{sec:intro_scope}

As shown in \cite{goodrich2007human} only a subset of \gls{hri} is designed to be inherently social. Using Goodrich and Schultz's definition of \gls{hri}, as the study of robots for use by or with humans, an important part of the field does not consider the social side of the interaction. Robots are often considered as non-social entities having a task to complete or simply tools to be used by humans. However, as demonstrated by \cite{fincannon2004evidence}, even when used as tele-operated machines, robots still provoke social reactions and expectations from humans. \cite{fong2003survey} make, among others, the distinction between ``evocative robots'' and ``socially interactive robots''. Evocative robots rely on human tendency to anthropomorphise to succeed in their task, while for ``socially interactive robots'' the social side of the interaction is key. As such, in \gls{hri}, the sociality of the interaction might not be intended or even desired but may simply emerge as a by-product of the interaction. As a consequence, in this work we will refer to ``social robots'' as robots interacting in humans environments and considered as social agents by the humans interacting with them. The intentions of the robot designer or the actual robot's sociality are of minor importance if the humans interacting with the robot project social competencies or expectations on the robot. Regardless of the initial intentions, a robot interacting with humans needs to manage these expectations to ensure the safety and comfort of its human partners. In summary, as soon as a robot interacts with humans, the social side of the interaction needs to be taken into account, i.e. the robot needs a social policy. 

However, enabling a robot to interact socially with humans is a complex task. The robot needs to make sense of sensory input, from low level sensory feedback (e.g. joint angles or camera pixels) to high level concepts (e.g. hand-coded events or learned features). And based on the interpretation of these inputs and rules defining a behaviour, the robot needs to select an action or a plan to achieve an assigned goal. As this task covers most of the areas of robotics~\citep{fong2003survey}, this section will define the scope of the research conducted in this thesis.

\subsection{Frame}

The context of the research conducted here is finding a way for robots to interact efficiently with humans. It has been argued by many researchers ~\citep{dautenhahn2004robots,billard2008robot} that robots need to adapt to their users and be able to learn from them. Social robots cannot simply apply a one-size-fits-all policy programmed in advance by engineers and suited to every possible interaction partner. Robots need the capability to learn interactive behaviours, improving their skills as they inhabit the world and personalising their policy to their users. This thesis aims to tackle this challenge and to provide a framework enabling robots to learn to interact with people.

Throughout this thesis we make the assumption that people knows how robots should interact. A person, generally not the engineers who have developed the robot, possesses some expertise which should be transferred to a robot. This expertise is not related to theoretical knowledge in \gls{ml}, robotics or other scientific fields but instead is about how the robot should behave. For instance,  it could take the form of the steps of a therapeutical intervention a robot should deliver to a child (known to a therapist) or more simply a senior's preferences and desires concerning a robot companion's behaviour. As a consequence, robots' users should be able to teach their robot without requiring technical expertise.

The ultimate goal of this research is to explore how robots could learn to interact socially and efficiently with humans from observing tele-operation of the robot. More specifically, this work addresses the problem of action selection: assuming a perception of the world and a finite set of predefined actions, the robot has to find the best action for each situation. The problems of defining actions (how to execute a high level action), extending the number of actions available to the robot and refining the perception are not covered by this work, but would be interesting future or complementary research. For example, a robot companion at home would learn when to do actions (such as setting the table or cleaning the dishes) but not the motor commands required to complete such actions (we assume the robot has access to an implementation of each available actions).

By making the assumption that the interaction knowledge should be provided by a human, the resulting question of this thesis is: \emph{`How can humans teach robots to interact?'}. As such, this research work aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for domain experts to inculcate robots with their interaction knowledge. To do so, this research explores the requirements on an interaction framework allowing humans to teach robots to interact socially in human environments and studies the impacts such a framework would have on the interaction.

\subsection{Type of Interaction}

In \gls{hri}, as in other robot applications, a robot has to solve a task with or for a human, we coin this interaction the \emph{application interaction}. However, by focusing the research on using humans to teach robots, we add a second human-robot interaction to this application interaction: the \emph{teaching interaction} between the robot and its teacher. The end goal of this new teaching interaction is to achieve high standards in the application interaction. This results in two intertwined human-robot interactions: the application interaction, between the application target and the robot, and the teaching interaction, between the teacher and the robot (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}). This is equivalent to a general triadic interaction between the human target, the robot and the human teacher.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{setup.pdf}
	\centering
	\caption{The typical interaction used in this research: a robot interacts with a target in an application interaction and learns from a domain expert through a teaching interaction.}
	\label{fig:intro_setup}
\end{figure}

The applications presented in this work focus on social \gls{hri} as the application domain. However, the methods and algorithms presented in this thesis are applicable to the broader domain in which a robot, or more generally an agent, learns a behaviour, more precisely what action (or label) it should select from a finite set. However, interacting with a human is a high-stakes scenario, where wrong decisions can have serious consequences, where datapoints for learning can be costly to acquire, and with a high diversity between different partners. Other types of interaction could be less constrained, less complex or with lower stakes. Consequently, by addressing the challenging task of teaching a robot to interact socially with humans, the methods and algorithms developed in this work should also be applicable in other environments. In the more general case, we consider scenarios where a user has a task they would like an artificial agent to complete and they have useful knowledge they want to transfer to this agent. Through the teaching interaction, the human can supervise the agent, demonstrating what it should do and teaching it an efficient policy in the application interaction with the target.

\section{The Thesis}\label{sec:intro_thesis}

The main thesis this document proposes is the following:
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{\thesis.}
\end{quote}

By giving a human control over a robot's behaviour and allowing this human to provide demonstrations, the robot could progressively and efficiently build up a policy by interacting in the real world. As the robot's policy improves, the requirement of demonstrations from the human decreases until the robot's policy is sufficiently appropriate to interact autonomously if desired.

This thesis raises a series of additional research questions; and, in the pursuit of supporting the main thesis, this research work addressed the six research questions presented below.

The first two questions correspond to a theoretical analysis of the field of social \gls{hri} and a proposition of an interaction framework allowing humans to teach robots in high stakes environments such as \gls{hri}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [RQ1] \emph{What are the requirements of a robot controller for social \gls{hri}?} 
	
		By interacting with humans, robots enter the social world and have to conform to human expectations while ensuring they can reach their goal. This research question studies the constraints put on the robot's controller by interacting in the human world. 
		
    \item [RQ2] \emph{What interaction framework would allow a human to teach a robot while meeting the requirements from RQ1?}
    
    	This research question explores the principles that would lead to an efficient teaching interaction between a robot and a human whilst meeting the requirements from RQ1 for the interaction between the robot and the target. 
\end{itemize}    	

Then, questions 3 and 4 are focused on the teaching interaction and evaluate the specific relation between the teacher and the robot. As such, these questions correspond to situations where the application interaction is fixed and repeatable. These controlled application interactions help us to characterise the teaching interaction, and analyse if it would be suited to teach a robot to interact with humans.
\begin{itemize}
    \item [RQ3] \emph{Could a robot decrease its supervisor's workload by proposing actions based on observing the supervisor's earlier decisions?}
    
        Controlling a robot can be a significant burden for the human supervisor. This question explores whether including a learning component in the robot behaviour and proposing actions to the human could relieve or alleviate their workload by taking over some of the mental and physical requirements of the robot control. Additionally, this question explores whether this learning impacts the performance in the task.
    
    \item [RQ4] \emph{When teaching a robot, how does the control over the robot's actions by the teacher impact on the teaching process in terms of performance, effort and teaching time?} 
    
    	Teaching robots has a unique property compared to teaching humans in the fact that the teacher can have total control over the learner's actions. This question explores whether this control could lead to a faster and more efficient learning while lightening the process for the teacher.
\end{itemize}    	

Finally, questions 5 and 6 evaluate the implications of having a human directly teaching a robot to interact with another human in a real situation, more precisely in the context of child tutoring. In this context, teaching the robot to interact with humans creates a triadic interaction where three agents (the teacher, the robot and child) are learning and changing their behaviours over time. These questions are specifically evaluating the \gls{sparc}, the interaction framework proposed by this work to address RQ2 (cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc}).

\begin{itemize}
	\item [RQ5] \emph{What impact does \gls{sparc} have on the performance of the child-robot interaction, the comfort for the teacher and the robot's learning?}

		Using humans to teach robots to interact with other humans results in two linked interactions. This question studies the impact of the teaching process on these two interactions: are the requirements from RQ1 validated in the application interaction? Is the teaching interaction efficient and convenient for the teacher? Is the robot learning quickly an efficient policy?
		
    \item [RQ6] \emph{After having been taught using \gls{sparc}, could a robot behave autonomously in a social context?}

	 	With \gls{sparc}, a robot could be deployed after a teaching phase to interact autonomously in the real world. This question analyses the robot's behaviour when interacting autonomously and explores the efficiency of a teacher \textit{in situ} to provide the robot an autonomous behaviour validating principles from RQ1.
	 
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Approach}

\subsection{Review of the State of the Art in \gls{hri}}

The first step toward answering the RQ1 and identifying the requirements interacting with humans puts on robots was to review the different fields of application of social \gls{hri}. In each type of interaction, the robot will interact with people with different specificities and needs, and by analysing these fields, we can draw the requirements such interactions put on the robot's controller. For this survey, we limited the applications to cases where humans consider the robot as a social agent, as this is the main feature we use to define social \gls{hri}.

\subsection{New Teaching Framework}

To address the requirements on a robot controller emerging by addressing RQ1, we propose the \gls{sparc}, a novel teaching framework intended to provide a way for non-experts in robotics to safely teach a robot to interact with humans. \gls{sparc} is the cornerstone of this thesis and this research work describes and justifies this approach, and evaluates its impact though three studies of increasing complexity.

\subsection{Study Design} 

To address the main thesis of this work and RQ3 to RQ6, we designed and ran three studies, which are described in detail in Chapters~\ref{chap:woz} to~\ref{chap:tutoring}. These studies evaluated the impacts of \gls{sparc} on different parts of the teaching and application interactions. The first two studies focused on the teaching interaction, i.e. the impact of \gls{sparc} on the teachers and the relation between the teacher and the robot. As a consequence, they required repeatable environments to compare humans' efficiency and experiences when teaching a robot. The last study applied \gls{sparc} to a real \gls{hri} and was run in schools with a single human teaching a robot to interact with children over multiple sessions. Its main goal was to explore whether \gls{sparc} can be used to teach a robot to interact with humans. All the studies used \gls{sparc} in the type of interaction presented in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}, i.e. a teacher wants a robot to complete a task (included but not limited to human interaction) and can control the robot's actions through an interface. As each study focused on different features of \gls{sparc}, bespoke interaction environments and test benches have been developed for each study.

The first study (Chapter~\ref{chap:woz}) explored if \gls{sparc} could be used to provide learning to a robot in a \gls{woz} interaction and whether this learning would impact the workload and performance of the teacher in the task. This study was designed around a task commonly found in \gls{rat}: emotion recognition for children with \gls{asd}~\citep{dautenhahn2004towards}. In our version of the task, a child would be presented images on a touchscreen and would have to classify them as displaying a positive or negative emotion. On the other side of the screen, a robot can provide some support to help the child to improve in the task. For this study, we decided to replace the child interacting with the robot by a second robot running a model of a child displaying typical features observed in children (such as non-deterministic behaviour, partial observability of state and absence of easily definable optimal policy). This repeatable environment allowed us to evaluate in a controlled study the impact of \gls{sparc} on the teacher and compare \gls{sparc} to \gls{woz}.

The second study (Chapter~\ref{chap:control}) compared \gls{sparc} to another \gls{iml} method: \gls{irl} in a replication of the environment initially used to test it~\citep{thomaz2008teachable}. On a computer screen, a virtual robot is in a kitchen and has to learn a sequence of actions to bake a cake. Additionally, a participant can provide rewards and guidance to help the robot to learn faster. This environment is deterministic with more than 10,000 states, between 3 and 7 actions per state and with an optimal policy reaching a success in 28 steps. The main difference between our method and the one proposed in the original paper resides in the quantity of control provided to the teacher; unlike \gls{irl}, \gls{sparc} provides teachers with full control over the robot's actions. 

Finally, the last study (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}) deployed \gls{sparc} in a real interaction with humans, to teach children about food chains. This study used the paradigm described in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_setup}: a child is playing an educational game with a robot on a large touchscreen and the robot is remotely controlled and taught by an adult using a tablet. That way, using \gls{sparc}, the robot can learn to support the child in the educative activity and increase their engagement and performance in the task.

\subsection{Learning Algorithms}

To enable robots to learn from humans, they need to be equipped with \acrfull{ml}, in this case an algorithm statistically learning a mapping between some inputs (perceived state) and outputs (possible actions). Two main categories of \gls{ml} are relevant for this research: \gls{sl} and \gls{rl}.

\gls{sl} aims to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs to automatically reproduce a desired and known behaviour. It uses a dataset of labelled examples and optimises a mapping to minimise the prediction error of labels~\citep{russell2016artificial}. Typical examples of \gls{sl} used in this study are \gls{ann} and nearest neighbours methods. \gls{ann} loosely model the way brains and neurons work by having a group of interconnected ``neurons'' influencing each other. By changing the strength of the connections between the neurons, the network learns to reproduce the desired values on the output nodes according to the inputs. On the other hand, nearest neighbours methods are instance based methods. They compare the distance in a feature space between a point to classify and the different instances stored in a dataset and select the value of a majority of nearest neighbours in that space~\citep{cover1967nearest}. With its goal, reproducing a desired behaviour, \gls{sl} is especially connected with the work carried out in this research. By learning to reproduce the teacher's policy, the robot should reach an efficient behaviour in the target application.

Unlike \gls{sl} which reproduces a known behaviour, \gls{rl} aims at providing an agent with the capacity to discover and explore the world it inhabits and learn by interacting in this environment how to behave~\citep{sutton1998reinforcement}. The agent has access to a description of the state and actions it can do, and depending on the action selected, the state will change and the agent will receive a reward. The goal of the agent is to find an optimal policy maximising a notion of cumulated reward. \gls{rl} is also linked to the work presented in this thesis: by allowing an agent (here a robot) to learn by interacting a world (here human environments), we would reach our goals of efficient human-robot interactions.

Due to the relevance of both fields to this research (enabling robots to learn to interact), algorithms from both categories have been used. The first study presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:woz} used a feed forward neural network learning to reproduce a teacher policy. The second study in Chapter~\ref{chap:control} used \gls{rl} to combine human guidance with environmental and human rewards to learn an efficient policy. The last study presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring} used an instance based algorithm adapted from Nearest Neighbours to enable online quick and efficient learning from human commands. More details about each algorithms and their related work can be found in the associated chapters.

\subsection{Terminology}

Throughout this thesis, the terms `wizard', `supervisor', `user', `expert' and `teacher' have been used interchangeably to represent the people in control of a robot's actions and teaching that robot a policy. Similarly, we refer to the robot as `robot', `agent' or `learner' depending on the context. The intended meaning of terms will be clear from the context.

Additionally, the term `policy' is used many times throughout this manuscript. A policy can be understood as a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each possible action~\citep{sutton1998reinforcement}. A policy can be deterministic (if for any given state, one action has a probability of 1 and the others a probability of 0) or stochastic; in any case, a policy is sufficient to determine an agent's behaviour.

\section{Contributions}\label{sec:intro_contr}

This research work contributed both scientifically (by creating and evaluating \gls{sparc}) and technically (by developing software for multiple projects) to the state of the art in \gls{hri} and especially in teaching robots to interact with humans. This section highlights the original contribution of this thesis and indicates the relevant chapters and published work.

\subsection{Scientific Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The first contribution, and the cornerstone of this work is the \textbf{\acrfull{sparc}}, a new interaction framework to \textbf{teach a robot to interact in complex and high stakes environments}, whereby the robot progressively gains autonomy while being supervised by a human. (Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc}; \citealt{senft2015human,senft2015sparc}).
	
	\item We then \textbf{evaluated \gls{sparc} in three studies} of increasing complexity, culminating into a final experiment in which we \textbf{taught a robot to support child learning} in the wild. (Chapters~\ref{chap:woz},~\ref{chap:control} and~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2015sparc,senft2017supervised,senft2018robots}).
	
	\item We showed that by \textbf{learning from a human's commands}, a robot could reduce the need for the human to manually select actions it should execute, thus \textbf{reducing the workload on this human operator}. (Chapter~\ref{chap:woz}; \citealt{senft2015sparc})	
	
	\item We demonstrated the impact and importance of the \textbf{teacher's control over the robot's action} when teaching a robot: it \textbf{makes the teaching safer, faster, easier and more efficient} (Chapter~\ref{chap:control}; \citealt{senft2016sparc,senft2017supervised}).
	
	\item We designed a lightweight algorithm \textbf{adapted from Nearest Neighbours}, but defined on a \textbf{sliced version of the state and using rewards} to \textbf{quickly learn from demonstrations in multidimensional environments} (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2017toward}).
	
	\item We used \gls{sparc} to \textbf{safely teach robots social autonomy}  from \textit{in situ} human supervision in a \textbf{real human-robot interaction} (Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}; \citealt{senft2018robots}). This is one of the main contributions as allowing a robot to learn to interact with people \textit{in situ} presents many advantages compared to other types of learning (e.g. \textbf{constantly appropriate behaviour in the learning phase, fast learning and transparency}) and can lead to an \textbf{autonomous behaviour similar to one resulting from human control}. However, this learning \emph{in situ} is seldomly used in \gls{hri} due the challenges it presents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Software development for three different studies to evaluate \gls{sparc} in three different applications, with dedicated interface for the teacher, and combining \gls{sparc} with a different algorithm each time.
	\item Implementation of a new algorithm to learn quickly from human demonstrations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Technical Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Partial development of a cognitive architecture and two tools for the \acrshort{dream} project (European FP7 project: 611391) (Appendix~\ref{app:dream}; \citealt{esteban2017build}).
	\item Development of an autonomous robot controller to support cardiac rehabilitation in the Human-Robot Interaction Strategies for Rehabilitation based on Socially Assistive Robotics project (Royal Academy of Engineering: IAPP\textbackslash1516\textbackslash137)~\citep{lara2017human,casas2018social}.
	\item Development of a wizard interface for the Freeplay-Sandbox\footnote{\url{https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox}}~\citep{lemaignan2018pinsoro,wallbridge2018spatial}.

\section{Structure}\label{sec:intro_struct}

The structure of this thesis is described below with an overview of the content for each chapter. Chapters~\ref{chap:sparc} to~\ref{chap:tutoring} start with a summary of the key elements to clarify their contribution.

\begin{itemize}
	\item This chapter introduced to the general scope and context of this research (robots learning to interact with and from humans), presented the main thesis put forward by this work as well as the technical and scientific contributions and the additional research questions addressed throughout the thesis .

	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:background} provides a description of the different fields of social \gls{hri} and draws requirements for controllers of robots interacting with humans. In a second part, it provides an overview of the current robot controllers used in \gls{hri} identifying that no current controller fits these requirements. Finally, it introduces \gls{iml} and proposes to apply it to \gls{hri} as a way to validate the previously defined requirements.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc} proposes a new interaction framework, \gls{sparc}, as a way to apply \gls{iml} to \gls{hri} while validating the three requirements proposed in Chapter~\ref{chap:background}. This chapter describes the principles behind \gls{sparc} and the expectations and limits this method could have.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:woz} presents a first study evaluating the impact of \gls{sparc} on the supervisor's workload and performance compared to \gls{woz}. Results showed that \gls{sparc} allowed teachers to achieve a good performance, while reducing their workload.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:control} presents a second study comparing \gls{sparc} to \gls{irl}, another interaction framework from \gls{iml}. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the amount of control the teacher has: only with \gls{sparc}, the teacher has full control over the actions executed by the robot. Results from a 40 participants study supported that this control improves the efficiency of the learning (improving the performance, reducing the time and the number of inputs required to teach as well as decreasing the risks taken during the teaching phase and imposing a lower workload on the teacher).
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring} presents the first study where \gls{sparc} has been applied to a real world \gls{hri}, child tutoring, and to our knowledge one of the first time online learning has been used to teach robots to interact with humans. Results demonstrate that, while not impacting the learning gain of the session, a supervised robot elicited richer child behaviour compared to a passive robot. Furthermore, by learning using \gls{sparc}, an autonomous robot reached a policy similar to the teacher's one and achieved similar impacts on the children. These results support \gls{sparc} as a teaching method allowing to transfer \textit{in situ} a social and technical policy from a human to a robot in a safe way and leading to an efficient autonomous behaviour. These findings are key for this thesis as they demonstrate the applicability of \gls{sparc} to high-stakes, unpredictable, multidimensional, multimodal and complex environments.
	
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} presents a discussion of the main findings from the previous chapters in relation to the research questions introduced in this chapter. It also discusses the limitations and future directions of research for \gls{sparc} as well as its potential impact on \gls{hri} and other fields.

	\item Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes the thesis by presenting a summary and stating the main contributions.
	
\end{itemize}
