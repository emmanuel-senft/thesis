\section{Motivation}

The \gls{sparc} has been designed to enable end-users without expertise in computer science to teach a robot a policy while interacting in a sensitive environment, such as \gls{hri}. By using machine learning and \gls{sa}, \gls{sparc} intends to allow a field expert to progressively transfer their knowledge to an autonomous agent without having to enforce each action manually. Additionally, as the agent is interacting in the target environment, displaying an appropriate policy, the time spent to teach it is not lost but used to deliver the desired interaction even during the learning phase. For example, in the context of \gls{rat}, a therapist would teach the robot during therapy sessions. And, as the therapist is in total control of the robot's action, the behaviour expressed by the robot always fits the  desired goals for the therapy. This ensures that even the sessions used to teach the robot have a therapeutic value for the patient involved in the therapy.

\gls{sparc}, as a principle, allows to start a robotic application in a \gls{woz} fashion and then move away from it as the robot gains autonomy. The aim of \gls{sparc} is twofold: maintaining a high level of performance in the target application while reducing the workload on the teacher over time. As the robot learns, the policy is refined until reaching a point where the robot can be autonomous or only requires a minimal supervision to interact successfully. 

The first step to evaluate \gls{sparc} was to focus on the teaching interaction, the relation between the robot and its teacher. To evaluate this aspect of the interaction, we decided to select a scenario inspired from \gls{rat} for children with \gls{asd}. A child has to complete a task (here emotion recognition) with a robot controlled by a therapist using \gls{woz} (e.g. \citealt{vanderborght2012using}). 

As explained in Chapter~\ref{chap:sparc} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:frame}, applying \gls{sparc} to this type of scenario results in the presence of two interactions: the teaching interaction (between the teacher and the robot) and the application one (between the child and the robot). These two dependent interactions add complexity to the evaluation of the approach and decrease the repeatability of the test benchmark, especially as both humans are impacting each other. 

Consequently, we decided to replace the child involved in the therapy by a robot running a model of a child. The setup ends up with two robots interacting together: the \emph{child-robot} completing a therapeutic task and the \emph{wizarded-robot} (controlled by a participant taking the role of the teacher) supporting the child-robot in its task completion (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:woz_setup_diag}). Actions from the wizarded-robot impact the child-robot's behaviour and to achieve a high performance in the task, the child-robot needs to receive an efficient supporting policy from the wizarded-robot. As such, the child-robot's performance is used as a proxy to evaluate the performance of the participant in the supervision. This environment with a single human-robot interaction allows us to observe and evaluate the impact of \gls{sparc} on the teaching interaction, while controlling for variable interactions with the target.

\section{Scope of the Study}

The study presented in this chapter intends to evaluate if the learning component of \gls{sparc} could allow participants to teach an efficient policy for a robot interacting with humans. For repeatability concerns, the application target (the child interacting with the robot) was modelled by another robot with a non-deterministic but repeatable behaviour. The control condition is a variation of \gls{woz}, where participant still control a robot but without the learning component. By combining learning and \gls{sa}, \gls{sparc} aims to allow the teacher to maintain a high performance during the interaction while reducing the workload on the teacher over time.

To evaluate the validity of \gls{sparc} and the influence of such an approach, four hypotheses were devised:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [H1] The child-robot's performance is a good proxy for the teacher's performance (there is high correlation between the child-robot performance and the teacher performance - maintaining the child-robot internal states high).
	\item [H2] When interacting with a new system, humans progressively build a personal strategy that they will use in subsequent interactions (resulting in variable teacher's outputs and improving their performance in successive interactions).
	\item [H3] Reducing the number of interventions required from a teacher reduces their perceived workload.
	\item [H4] \gls{sparc} allows the teacher to achieve similar performance than \gls{woz} but with a lower workload.
\end{enumerate}

H1 represents a validation of the model, ensuring that the child-robot performance represents the efficiency of the policy applied by the teacher. H2 tests that human teachers are not static entities, they adapt their teaching target and their interaction strategy based on their knowledge and understanding of the task. H3 tests one of the motivations behind \gls{sparc}: does reducing the number of physical actions from a human to control a robot while requiring the teacher to monitor the robot suggestions lead to a lower perceived workload. Finally, H4 is the main hypothesis, it tests if \gls{sparc} can enable a robot to learn a useful policy: reducing the teacher's workload while maintaining a high performance in the application interaction.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participants}

The study involved 10 participants (7M/3F, age \textit{M}=29.3, 21 to 44, \textit{SD}=4.8 years). While \gls{sparc} is expected to be usable by anyone, regardless of their knowledge of computer sciences, this first study involved members of a robotic research group assuming the role of the robot supervisor. This decision is supported by the fact that in \gls{rat} scenarios, the wizard is typically a technically competent person with significant training controlling this robot for this therapy. As such, as the participants come from a population expected to assume this type role, the results of the study maintain their applicability to \gls{hri}.

\subsection{Task}

This study is based on a real scenario for \gls{rat} for children with \gls{asd} based on the Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy framework~\citep{cooper2007applied}. The aim of the therapy is to help a child to develop/practice their social skills by completing tasks with a human or robotic partner. The child has to complete an emotion recognition task by playing a categorisation game with a robot on a mediating touchscreen device~\citep{baxter2012touchscreen}. The robot can provide feedback and prompts to encourage the child and help them to classify emotions. In the task, images of faces or drawings are shown to the child on the touchscreen, and the child has to categorise them by moving them to one side of the screen or the other depending on whether the picture shown denotes happiness or sadness. In real therapies, the robot would be generally remote-controlled by an operator using \gls{woz}~\citep{riek2012wizard}.

This study explores if \gls{sparc} can be used to teach the robot a correct policy to support the child in this therapy scenario. As timing in human-robot interactions is complex, for simplification reasons, the interaction has been made discrete to have clear steps when the robot has to execute an action. During these action steps, the selection of an action is decided by following the principles defining the \gls{sa}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The robot suggests an action to the teacher.
	\item The teacher can select an action for the robot to execute or let the proposed action be executed after a short delay.
	\item The robot executes the selected action.
	\item Both the robot and the teacher observe the outcome of the action until the next action selection step.
\end{enumerate}

This study compares two conditions: the \gls{sparc} condition, where the robot learns from the participant's selections and the \gls{woz} condition where the robot is simply controlled by the participant. As this was the first version evaluating \gls{sparc}, the time component of the interaction was artificially discretised; however, this limitation was addressed in future work (cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:tutoring}). In both conditions, actions can only be executed in predefined time windows dictated by the dynamics of the interaction (cf. Section~\ref{ssec:woz_wizarded_robot}). As some situations would require the robot not to act, a `wait' action was added to the \gls{sparc} condition and presented an active choice for the participants.
In a real \gls{woz} scenario, participants would have to enforce every single action made by the robot, however, a `wait' action would simply correspond to the absence of selection from the wizard. To maintain comparability between the conditions, in the \gls{woz} condition, the robot proposes random actions. While not being a classical \gls{woz} situation, we would expect that the requirement for the teacher to select the `wait' action when required would balance the cases when the robot randomly proposes a correct action. This random behaviour is also the starting point of the \gls{sparc} condition.

As mentioned earlier, the focus of the study being on the teaching interaction (the relation between the teacher and the robot), the second interaction (the application) was kept constant by replacing the child by a robot. A minimal model of child behaviour is therefore used to stand in for a real child. A second robot is employed in the interaction to embody this child model: we term this robot the \textit{child-robot} while the robot being directly supervised by the human teacher is the \textit{wizarded-robot} (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:woz_setup}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}
		
\subsection{Child Model} \label{ssec:woz_child}

The purpose of the child model is not to realistically model a child (with or without autism), but to provide a means of expressing some characteristics of the behaviours we observed in interactions with children in a repeatable manner. The child-robot possesses an internal model encompassing an engagement level and a motivation level. Together these form the state of the child. The engagement represents the involvement of the child in the task, i.e. how often the child-robot will make categorisation moves. And the motivation relates to the seriousness of the child in solving task; in the model, the motivation gives the probability of success of each categorisation move. 

These states are bound to the range [-1, 1] and influenced by the behaviour of the wizarded-robot. Values of 1 indicate that the child-robot's behaviour is positive, it is involved in the task. Values of -1 show that the child-robot is actively refusing to participate. And a 0 represents a neutral state where the child-robot is neither especially involved nor actively disengaged. To represent a tendency to return to a neutral state of mild engagement, both states asymptotically decay to zero with no actions from the wizarded-robot. These two states are not directly accessed by either the teacher or the wizarded-robot, but can be observed through behaviour expressed by the child-robot: low engagement will make the robot look away from the touchscreen, and the speed of the categorisation moves is related to the motivation (to which gaussian noise was added). There is thus incomplete/unreliable information available to both the wizarded-robot and the teacher.

As explained in Section~\ref{ssec:woz_wizarded_robot}, the wizarded-robot's actions impact the child-robot state: congruent actions will tend to increase engagement and motivation. However, if repeated, actions can lead to frustration for the child-robot. If a state is already high and an action from the wizarded-robot should increase it further, there is a chance that this level will sharply decrease. When this happens, the child-robot will indicate this frustration verbally by uttering one of eight predefined strings. This mechanism prevent the optimal strategy to be straightforward: always making actions aiming to increase motivation or engagement. The optimal strategy combines feedback actions and waiting ones to maintain the state values high but prevent them from overshooting. This non-trivial optimal policy approximates better a real human-robot interaction scenario requiring a more complex strategy to be expressed by the robot.

\subsection{Wizarded-Robot Control} \label{ssec:woz_wizarded_robot}

The wizarded-robot is controlled through a \gls{gui} (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:woz_gui}) and has access to the variables defining the state of the interaction used by the learning algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Observed engagement.
	\item Observed motivation.
	\item Type of last categorisation made by the child-robot (good/bad/done).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{GUI-woz.png}
	\caption{Screenshot of the interface used by the participants, the \gls{gui} on the left allows to control the robot and a summary of the actions' impact is displayed on the right.}
	\label{fig:woz_gui}
\end{figure}

Additionally, other metrics are displayed to the teacher but not used by the algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Number of categorisations made by the child-robot.
	\item Time since teacher's last action.
	\item Time since child-robot's last action.
	\item Child-robot's performance.
	\item Total time elapsed.
\end{itemize}

The wizarded-robot has a set of four actions it can execute, each represented by a button on the \gls{gui}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Prompt an Action}: Encourage the child-robot to do an action.
	\item \textbf{Positive Feedback}: Congratulate the child-robot on making a good classification.
	\item \textbf{Negative Feedback}: Supportive feedback for an incorrect classification.
	\item \textbf{Wait}: Do nothing for this action opportunity, wait for the next one.
\end{itemize}

The impact of actions on the child-robot depends on the internal state and the type of the last child-robot move: good, bad, or done (meaning that feedback has already been given for the last move and supplementary feedback is not necessary). A \textit{prompt} increases the engagement, a \textit{wait} has no effect on the child-robot's state, and the impact of positive and negative feedback depends on the previous child-robot move. Congruous feedback (positive feedback for correct moves; negative feedback for incorrect moves) results in an increase in motivation, but incongruous feedback can decrease both the motivation and the engagement of the child-robot. The teacher therefore has to use congruous feedback and prompts.

However, as mentioned in Section~\ref{ssec:woz_child}, if the engagement or the motivation exceeds a threshold, their value can decrease abruptly to simulate the child-robot being frustrated. This implies that the optimal policy consist on providing congruous feedback and prompts, but also requires wait actions to prevent the child-robot from becoming frustrated and maintain its state-values close to the threshold without exceeding it. However, as the participants do not know the parameters of the models running on the child-robot and do not have access to the exact state values, this optimal policy is not available to participants. A `good' strategy keeping the engagement and motivation high leads to an increase in performance of the child-robot in the categorisation task.

As mentioned earlier, in this study the teacher cannot select actions for the wizarded-robot at any time. Actions can only be executed at specific times triggered by the wizarded-robot: two seconds after each child-robot categorisation or if nothing happened for five seconds since the last wizarded-robot's action. When these selection windows are hit, the wizarded-robot proposes an action to the teacher by displaying the action's name and a countdown before execution. The teacher can only select an action in reaction to a proposition from the wizarded-robot; alternatively, if the teacher does nothing in the three seconds following the suggestion, the action proposed by the wizarded-robot is executed. This mechanism allows the teacher to passively accept a suggestion or actively intervene by selecting a different action and forcing the wizarded-robot to execute it.

\subsection{Learning Algorithm}

In the \gls{sparc} condition, the robot learns to reproduce the policy displayed by the teacher. For this study, the algorithm is of incidental importance, any algorithm could have been used, but as only supervised learning is required, we used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with five input nodes: one for the observed motivation, one for the observed engagement and three binary (+1/-1) inputs for the type of the previous move: good, bad, or done. The hidden layer had six nodes and the output layer four: one for each action and each layer used a sigmoid activation function. The suggested action is selected by applying a Winner-Take-All strategy on the value of the output node and then displayed on the \gls{gui} before execution. The network is trained with back propagation: after each new decision from the teacher a new training point is added with the selected action node having +1 while the others are set to -1. The network is fully retrained with all the previous state-action pairs and the new one between each selection step. 

This learning algorithm, MLP, is not optimal for online learning for real time interactions as the learning should happen quickly between learning iterations. However, as the length of interaction (and so the number of datapoints) is limited, the network can be retrained between consecutive uses. Finally, the desired learning behaviour being purely supervised learning, this type of algorithm has been deemed suitable for this study.

\subsection{Interaction Protocol}

The study compared two conditions: a learning robot adapting its propositions to its user (the \gls{sparc} condition) and a non-learning robot constantly proposing random actions (the \gls{woz} condition). The child-robot controller was kept constant in both conditions, while the state was reset between interactions. The study used a within subject design with balancing of order: each participant interacted with both conditions, and the order of interaction has been balanced between participants to control for any ordering effects. In the order S-W the participants first interact with the learning wizarded-robot in the \gls{sparc} condition, and then with the non-learning one in the \gls{woz} condition; and in the order W-S, this interaction order is inverted (starting with \gls{woz} then \gls{sparc}). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two orders.

The interactions took place on a university campus in a dedicated experiment room. Both robots were Aldebaran Nao, one of which had a label indicating that it was the child-robot. The robots faced each other with a touchscreen between them. The participant, assuming the role of the teacher, sat at a desk to the side of the wizarded-robot, with a screen and a mouse to interact with the wizarded-robot (fig.~\ref{fig:woz_setup}). Participants were able to see the screen and the child-robot.

A document explaining the interaction scenario was provided to participants with a demographic questionnaire. After the information was read, a 30s video presenting the \gls{gui} in use was shown to participants to familiarise them with the interface, without biasing them towards any particular control strategy. Then participants clicked a button to start the first interaction which lasted for 10 minutes. The experimenter was sat in the room outside of the participants' field of view. After the end of the first interaction, a post-interaction questionnaire was administered. Similarly, in the second part of the experiment, the participants interacted with the other condition and completed a second post-interaction questionnaire. Finally, a post-experiment questionnaire asked participants to explicitly compare the two conditions. All questionnaires and the information sheet are presented in Appendix~\ref{app:woz_questionnaires}, and the files and the instruction video showing the interface can be found online\footnote{ \url{https://emmanuel-senft.github.io/experiment-woz.html}}.

\subsection{Metrics}

Two types of metrics have been recorded for this study: interaction data representing objective behaviours and the performance of the participants and subjective data through questionnaires.

\subsubsection{Interaction Data}

The state of the child-robot and the interaction values were logged at each step of the interaction (at 5Hz). At each selection step, all of the human actions were recorded: acceptance of the wizarded-robot's suggestion, auto-execution and selection of another action (intervention) as well as the current state of the child-robot (motivation, engagement and performance). 

The first metric is the performance achieved by participants in each interaction. As the policy applied by the participants cannot be evaluated directly, the performance of the child-robot in the task (number of correct categorisations minus number of incorrect categorisations) is used as a proxy for the participant performance. H1 evaluates if this approximation is valid by analysing the relation between the performance of the child-robot and the value of its inner states. If a strong correlation is found, it would demonstrate that a good supervision policy (managing to keep the engagement and the motivation of the child-robot high) leads to a high performance. As such, this child-robot performance represents how efficient the policy executed by the wizarded-robot was when controlled by a participant.

The second important metric is the intervention ratio: the number of times a user chooses a different action than the one proposed by the wizarded-robot, divided by the total number of executed actions. This metric represents how often on average a user had to correct the robot and could be related to the workload the user had to face to control the robot.

\subsubsection{Questionnaire Data}

Participants answered four questionnaires: a demographic one before the interaction, two post-interaction ones where they were asked to evaluate the last interaction with the robots and a post-experiment questionnaire where they had to compare the two conditions. All the rating questionnaires used seven item Likert scale. For clarity for participants, in the questionnaires the wizarded-robot is named `teacher-robot' (as it was `teaching' the child-robot).

Post-Interaction questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The child-robot learned during the interaction (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item The performance of the child-robot improved in response to the teacher-robot's actions (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item The teacher-robot is capable of making appropriate action decisions in future interactions without supervision (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item The teacher-robot always suggested an incorrect or inappropriate actions (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item By the end of the interaction, my workload was very light (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item What did you pay most attention during the interaction? (child-robot, touchscreen, \gls{gui}, other).
\end{itemize}

Post-experiment questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item There was a clear difference in behaviour between the two teacher-robots (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item There was a clear difference in behaviour between the two child-robots (Likert scale 1 to 7).
	\item Which teacher-robot was better able to perform the task? (first, second).
	\item Which teacher-robot did you prefer supervising? (first, second).
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

Graphs presented in this chapter and throughout this thesis have been generated using the seaborn package for Python and matplotlib~\citep{waskom2017seaborn}. Data is usually represented using violin plots, a graphical representation featuring the probability density of the data. In addition to this plot, graph also display the raw data points and in Chapters~\ref{chap:woz} and~\ref{chap:control} a minimal box plot showing the quartiles and outliers.

\subsection{Interaction Data}

Figure~\ref{fig:woz_comp} presents the aggregated results (collapsed between orders) for the performance and the final intervention ratio for both conditions. While the number of participants is not sufficient to compute descriptive statistics, overall interaction results seemed to show that both conditions lead to similar performance (\gls{sparc}: 32.6 (95\% CI [27.89,37.31]) - \gls{woz}: 31.4 (95\% CI [25.9,36.9])). As supported by the absence of overlap between the 95\% CI, the \gls{sparc} condition tended to require less interventions (intervention ratio: \gls{sparc}: 0.38 (95\% CI [0.29,0.47]) - \gls{woz}: 0.59 (95\% CI [0.52,0.67])).

	\label{fig:woz_comp}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:woz_ratio_time} presents the evolution of intervention ratio for each condition, and their order. During the first interaction, participants discovered the interface and how to interact with it, which resulted in a high variation of the intervention ratio in the first 20 steps (with one step corresponding to one proposition of action from the wizarded-robot). However in the second phase of the interaction, when participants had developed their teaching policy, there was a tendency for \gls{sparc} to require a lower number of intervention than \gls{woz}. This effect was higher in the second interaction, where as soon as 5 steps, the two conditions differentiated without overlap of the 95\% CI of the mean. This would indicate that the two conditions differ in term of required interventions.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Evolution of intervention ratio over time for both conditions and both orders. Shaded area represents the 95\% CI (N=5 for each plot).}
	\label{fig:woz_ratio_time}
\end{figure}

For both the performance and the intervention ratio, a strong ordering effect was observed. Figure~\ref{fig:woz_separated} and Table~\ref{tab:woz_comp_means} present the performance and final intervention ratio separated by condition and order. In both orders, the performance in the second interaction was higher than the one in the first interaction, as the participants were used to the system and developed an efficient interaction policy. On the other hand, the performance between condition for the same interaction number was similar (in both their first and second interactions, the condition of interaction did not impact the performance). However, for both orders, when comparing between condition for the same interaction number, the intervention ratio was lower when using \gls{sparc} compared to \gls{woz}. This indicates that when the wizarded-robot learned using \gls{sparc}, a similar performance was attained as with \gls{woz}, but the number of interventions required to achieve this performance was lower.

\end{table}

Additionally, a strong positive correlation (Pearson's \textit{r}=0.79) was found between the average child-robot motivation and engagement and its performance which shows that the performance achieved by the child-robot represented the capacity of the teacher to keep both engagement and motivation high.

\subsection{Questionnaire Data}

The post-interaction questionnaires evaluated the participant's perception of the child-robot's learning and performance, the quality of suggestions made by the wizarded-robot, and the experienced workload. All responses used seven point Likert scales. Table~\ref{tab:woz_quest_means} presents separated results for the questions asked in the post-interaction questionnaires, with more details for the questions exhibiting differences in Figure~\ref{fig:woz_quest}.

\end{figure}

Across the four possible interactions, the rating of the child-robot's learning was similar (\textit{M}=5.25, 95\% CI [4.8, 5.7]). As the child-robot was using the same interaction model in all four conditions, this result is expected. There is a slight tendency to rate the child's performance as being higher in the \gls{woz} condition but the error margin is too high to conclude anything. %This could indicate that the teachers were more aware of the child's behaviour as the workload was lighter to control the wizarded-robot.

Participants rated the wizarded-robot as more suited to operate unsupervised with \gls{sparc} than with \gls{woz}  (\gls{cidm} for S-W ordering [-0.2, 2.6], \gls{cidm} for the W-S ordering [1.6, 2.8]).

Similarly, a trend was found showing that the wizarded-robot with \gls{sparc} is perceived as making fewer errors than with \gls{woz} (\gls{cidm} for S-W ordering [1.3, 3.4], \gls{cidm} for the W-S ordering [0.1, 1.1]). 

Also participants tended to rate the workload as lighter when interacting with \gls{sparc}, and this effect is much more prominent when the participants interacted with the \gls{woz} first (\gls{cidm} for S-W ordering [-0.6, 2.6], \gls{cidm} for the W-S ordering [0.7, 2.5]).

Most of the difference of mean interval exclude 0 or include it marginally, which would indicate tendency of difference, but due to the low number of participants, no statistical tests are applicable and as such no significance can be demonstrated.

\section{Discussion}

Strong support for H1 (a good teacher leads to a better child performance) was found, a correlation between the average value of states (engagement and motivation) and the final performance for all of the 10 participants was observed (\textit{r}=0.79). This validity check confirms that the performance of the child robot reflects the performance of the teacher in this task: supervising the wizarded-robot to execute an efficient policy maximising the inner state of the child-robot. Additionally, the model of the child robot exhibited the desired behaviour: allowing a wide range of performances without one obvious optimal policy.

The results also provided support for H2 (teachers create personal strategies): all the participants performed better in the second interaction than in the first one. This suggests that participants developed a strategy when interacting with the system in the first interaction, and were able to use it to increase their performance in the second interaction. Looking in more detail at the interaction logs, different strategies for the wizarded-robot can be observed. For instance, the ratio of waiting action compared to other supportive actions varied between participants (from 4.7\% to 56\%). This variation demonstrates that despite the repeatability of the environment, different participants applied different strategies when controlling and teaching a robot.

H3 (reducing the number of interventions reduces the perceived workload) is partially supported: the results show a trend for participants to rate the workload as lighter when interacting with \gls{sparc}, and another trend between using \gls{sparc} and the intervention ratio. However, when computing the correlation between the intervention ratio and the reported workload, a strong effect can only be observed in the second interaction ($\rho = -.622$). In the first interaction, the main cause of the workload is probably the discovery of the system and how to interact with it rather than the requirement to manually select actions for the robot. Nevertheless, regardless of the order of the interactions, \gls{sparc} tended to receive higher ratings for lightness of workload and required fewer interventions to be controlled which indicates that using \gls{sparc} could decrease the workload on robots' supervisors compared to \gls{woz}.

Finally, H4 (using learning maintains similar performance, but decreases the workload) is supported: interacting with a learning robot in the \gls{sparc} condition resulted in a similar performance than interacting with a non-learning robot in the \gls{woz} condition, whilst requiring fewer active interventions from the supervisor and a lower workload to control. Reducing the workload on the robot operator has real world utility, for example, in the context of \gls{rat}, it might free time for the supervisor to allow them to focus on other aspects of the intervention, such as analysing the child's behaviour rather than solely controlling the robot. 

It should be noted that the actual learning algorithm used in this study is only of incidental importance, and that certain features of the supervisor's strategies may be better approximated with alternative methods -- of importance for the present work is the presence of learning at all. Other algorithms and ways to handle time have been used in the following studies presented in Chapters~\ref{chap:control} and~\ref{chap:tutoring}.

\section{Summary}

Using a suggestion/intervention system, \gls{sparc} allowed online learning for interactive scenarios, thus increasing autonomy and reducing the demands on the supervisor. Results showed that the learning component of \gls{sparc} allowed participants to achieve a similar performance as interacting with a non-learning robot, but requiring fewer interventions to attain this result. This suggests that while both conditions allowed the participants to reach a good performance, with \gls{sparc}, the presence of learning shifts part of the burden of selecting actions onto the wizarded-robot rather than on the human. Using \gls{sparc}, the robot partially learnt an interaction policy which decreased the requirement on the teacher to physically enforce each robot's action. This indicates that a learning robot could reduce the workload on the operator freeing them to do more valuable tasks and that \gls{sparc} could be an efficient interaction framework to operate this learning. In addition to providing a robot with autonomy, this reduction of workload has real world implications, in the context of \gls{rat}, it could allow the therapist to focus more on the child than on the robot, with improved therapeutic outcomes as potential result.
