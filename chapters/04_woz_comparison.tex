\chapter{Relation with Wizard of Oz}\label{chap:woz}
\begin{framed}
	\textbf{Key points:}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An experiment was designed to explore the influence of \gls{sparc} on the human workload and task performance compared to an approach based on \gls{woz}
		\item Design of a robot model exhibiting probabilistic behaviour with a non-trivial optimal interaction policy
		\item Results show that \gls{sparc} achieves a similar performance than \gls{woz} while requiring a lower workload from the supervisors
	\end{itemize}
