First, none of this would have been possible without Tony Belpaeme. Thank you Tony for giving me opportunity the to start this journey and meet so many people, for making me discover science, for your enthusiasm, your wit and your wisdom and for making me leave each meeting more motivated than when starting. Thank you also Paul Baxter for your quiet but sharp comments and ideas and your sense of understatement and S\'{e}verin Lemaignan for your energy, your positivity and your desire of technical complexity. Thank you to the three of you, for guiding me through these 4 years.

A special thank you to James Kennedy for showing me the way on what could be a PhD journey, for these 2 years and half sharing the office and a quite intense week in Romania to make DREAM work. To the DREAM team, for the fun of sharing meetings and the opportunity to collaborate of a bigger project. And especially to Hoang-Long Cao and Pablo Gomez for our weekly meetings. To Carlos Cifuentes, Marcela Munera and Jonathan Casas for a warm welcome in Colombia. To Madeleine Bartlett for long weeks in schools, repeating the same sentences to more than 100 children and teaching the robot. And Charlotte Edmunds, Madeleine Bartlett and Chris Wallbridge for accepting to proofread the whole thing, dealing with the frenchness of my spelling(/grammar) and make it definitely better! To everybody not mentioned yet and has been part of the HRI Plymouth team: Robin Read, Bahar Irfan, Fotios Popadopoulos, Daniel Hernandez, Serge Thill; to the Cognovians for the warm welcome on my arrival in Plymouth and people in B111 for being a vibrant PhD group.

And last thoughts for the ones would gave me the energy to enjoy working on this thesis: people in North Road East 90 who made the house a pleasant and welcoming place, I was always happy to return in the evenings, and friends in Plymouth and around the world (Pierre Henri, Thomas and Tunvez to cite only a few) who provided with pleasant distractions.

To my family and Yan for supporting me in the lower moments and making me feel appreciated at any time.
